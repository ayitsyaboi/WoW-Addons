## AutoJoin for TurtleWoW

This is a very basic addon that allows custom channels to be added account wide, meaning they will be there on every character you roll.

### Okay, how do I use it?

 Type "/aj" in chat and everything you need to know will be there. 

 For example "/aj add customchannel" will automatically join the channel and saves it to a local database that is account wide and will persist across all characters and accounts. 

### Shorthand commands are supported

Shorthand commands work, eg: "/aj join|j|a|add channelname" to add/join a channel and "/aj remove|rm|delete|del channelname" to leave/remove a channel.

### How do I know the channels I added?

Use "/aj list" to display all custom channels.
